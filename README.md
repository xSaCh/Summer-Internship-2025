## Introduction

During this internship, I worked as a Flutter Developer on a real-world application used by customers. My contributions ranged from initial setup and onboarding through to performance tuning and localization. Below is a week-by-week overview of the key areas I focused on, presented in a generalized form to respect company-specific confidentiality.

## Week 1: Onboarding & Foundations

* **Environment Setup:** Installed Flutter SDK, IDE plugins, emulators, and configured platform-specific tooling.
* **Version Control:** Learned the team’s Git branching strategy, set up GitHub repositories, and explored continuous integration basics.
* **Codebase Familiarization:** Reviewed the existing project structure, key modules, and style guidelines.
* **Scaffolded Initial Screens:** Built the basic app shell including home and authentication placeholders.

## Week 2: Core UI & Navigation

* **Bottom Navigation Bar:** Implemented an animated, three-tab navigation bar for primary app sections.
* **Home & Listing Screens:** Designed responsive layouts for item listings and detail views using Flutter widgets.
* **Filter & Search UI:** Created reusable dropdown and chip-based filter components with stateful handling.
* **Profile & Settings:** Added a profile screen scaffold with editable fields and loading indicators.

## Week 5: Optimization, Testing & Wrap-Up

* **Performance Tuning:** Reduced redundant API calls, introduced state caching, and optimized build methods for smoother scrolling.
* **Bug Fixes:** Addressed UI glitches, null-safety issues, and edge-case crashes uncovered during testing.
* **Collaboration:** Participated in sprint reviews, code reviews, and pair-programming sessions to ensure code quality.
* **Documentation & Handoff:** Prepared user stories, updated in-app documentation, and drafted guidelines for future feature work.
